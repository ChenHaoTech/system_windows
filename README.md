A [Flutter package](https://github.com/unitedideasco/system_windows.git) that that enables support for system tray menu for desktop flutter apps.

system_windows is a simple flutter package for fetching list of opened windows on your desktop. Works with MacOS, Windows and Linux.

Icons of opened apps are only supported by MacOS.

Install the package using `pubspec.yaml` and then use it this way:
